# WebServices

Ive made my Webservices project about books and authors.

The documentation of SOAP API can be found in the project root directory.

The documentation of REST API can be found via swagger (http://localhost:8080/WebService/swagger/)

The SOAP UI tests can be also found in the project root folder

The REST tests are written in postman and are too in project root folder
