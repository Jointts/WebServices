# WebServices

Ive made my Webservices project about books and authors.

## Info

The documentation of SOAP API can be found in the project root directory.

The documentation of REST API can be found via swagger (http://localhost:8080/WebService/swagger/)

The SOAP UI tests can be also found in the project root folder

The REST tests are written in postman and are too in project root folder

I went with the code first approach, the WSDL is auto-generated from Java.

## SOAP Client

The soap client is put in to the test class src/test/java/app.SOAP/LibraryServiceTest

## Not working?

If you get class not found errors, be sure that the maven dependencies are copied to the output path.
